- 👋 Hi, I’m @jfesmire5
- 👀 I’m interested in coding using primarily Python, but I am interested in learning other languages as well!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I spend a lot of my free time practicing coding using Python while also reading documenation to better understand the language. Other than this, I am also learning "how to code" from a top-down perspective.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Python automation and other applications.
- 📫 I can be reached at jfesmire5@gmail.com
